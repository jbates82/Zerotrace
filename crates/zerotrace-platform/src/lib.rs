//! Overwriting a file in place is not merely unreliable on some filesystems,
//! it is *meaningless* on copy-on-write ones. On Btrfs, ZFS or APFS a write
//! allocates new blocks and leaves the originals intact until they are
//! reclaimed, so the operation gives no assurance at all while looking exactly

//!
//! Reporting a uniform "best effort" across every filesystem therefore
