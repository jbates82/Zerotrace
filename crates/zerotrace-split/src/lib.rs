//! Split-key protection of the vault's release key.
//!
//! # The attack this exists for
//!
//! An attacker removes the drive, mounts it elsewhere and copies the vault.
//! They never run our code, so the deadman switch never fires: the policy and
//! journal are files they now control and can simply delete. Against that
//! attacker the only thing standing between them and the plaintext is the
//! password, and a password is guessable offline for as long as they like.
//!
//! Split-key protection changes what a stolen drive is worth. The key that
//! unwraps the master key is divided into shares, each sealed under a
//! different component. A drive holds every share *ciphertext*, so the
//! attacker gains nothing by copying them; opening any two requires two
//! independent secrets, and at least one of those is deliberately not on the
//! drive.
//!
//! # Why two of three
//!
//! Three of three sounds stronger and is worse. It means any single loss is
//! permanent data loss: a dead motherboard, a discontinued service, a
//! forgotten password. For a vault holding things a person cannot afford to
//! lose, that availability profile is a bigger risk than the attack it
//! prevents.
//!
//! Two of three still defeats drive theft. An attacker holding the disk and
//! the password has one component and needs two. It survives the loss of any
//! single component. The cost is stated rather than hidden: a compromised
//! remote service combined with a compromised password opens the vault without
//! the machine, so the remote component must be treated as a real credential
//! and not a convenience.
//!
//! # What is not solved here
//!
//! Rollback. An attacker who physically holds the drive can restore an older
//! copy of any file on it, including this one. Detecting that needs an anchor
//! they do not control: a monotonic counter in a TPM, or the remote service
//! refusing to release its share for a state it has already superseded.
//! Neither exists yet, and this crate does not pretend otherwise.
