             dates are encrypted too, so the vault does not even reveal what sort of things \
             it holds.",
            "You can also set a deadman switch. If you stop checking in for a period you \
             choose, the vault destroys its own key, and everything inside becomes \
             permanently unreadable. This is off unless you turn it on.",
            "Your original files are not moved or changed when you add them to a vault. A \

             neither can we: that is the point of the design, not a missing feature. If the \
             password is lost and you have not set up key protection, everything in the \
             vault is gone.",

             copy, so extracting does not empty it.",

             they are not running this program.",

             three pieces, and any two of them will open it. One piece is your password. The \
             other two are small files called tokens.",

             both tokens can open it without ever knowing your password.",

            "Somebody who has your computer, in person or remotely, can simply close the \
             watcher. Nothing can stop them. A hidden background program is visible in the \
             task list within a minute. Refusing to close without a password is defeated by \
             ending the task. Two programs restarting each other is how malware behaves and \
             is how your antivirus will treat it. On a machine somebody else controls, they \
             win that fight.",
            "So the deadline is not what defends you there. KEY PROTECTION is. An attacker \
             who stops the watcher buys themselves unlimited time to attack your vault, and \
             against a split key unlimited time is worth nothing: they hold one piece and \
             need two. A thousand years of guessing your password still leaves them a piece \
             short.",

             arrest, an accident, a border detention. In those cases nobody closes anything: \
             the machine simply sits there, the deadline passes, and the key is destroyed.",
            "Two things do help against a closed watcher. Stopping it postpones nothing, \
             because elapsed time is measured from recorded timestamps rather than by \
             counting: kill it for a week and the moment it runs again it sees that a week \
             has passed and acts at once. And it cannot be stopped quietly, because the next \
             start records that the previous one ended without shutting down, so you find \
             out on your return.",

             program you are alive, well, and acting freely. Doing so resets the countdown.",

             abandoned. Three days is a common choice.",
            "Heartbeat is how often you intend to check in. Inside that time your check-in \
             counts fully. After it, the presence score falls steadily until the timeout is \
             reached.",
            "Required confidence is how high that score must stay. Entering your password \
             scores 100. Weaker evidence, such as the computer being switched on, reachable \
             on the network, or having its keyboard used, is capped at 60 in total however \
             much of it there is.",
            "That cap is the reason the setting cannot go below 61. None of that weaker \
             evidence proves anything about you: a burglar sitting at your desk produces \
             every one of those signs, and so does a machine left running in an empty \
             house. A deadline that they could hold open would not be a deadman switch, it \
             would be a switch that notices whether the computer is on.",

             is running and has been given permission.",
            "That separation is deliberate. A checkbox should not be able to start something \
             that erases your files, and a program started by this window would stop the \
