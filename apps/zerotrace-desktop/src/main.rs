//! Apex ZeroTrace desktop window.
//!
//! A native front end over `zerotrace-ipc`. It contains no cryptography, no
//! policy evaluation and no destruction logic: every decision is made by the
//! core and arrives here as plain data.
//!
//! Passwords are held in a `String` only while a prompt is open, cleared the
//! moment the operation completes, and never stored between operations. That
//! is weaker than the core's `SecretBytes`, because egui needs an editable
//! `String` to render a text field, and it is stated plainly rather than
//! implied otherwise.
